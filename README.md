- 👋 Hi, I’m @kokostahr (can call me Star or Koko--)
- 👀 I’m interested in mobas, open world multiplayer games, otome visual novels, kpop, and manicures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use unity to make games, how to draw digitally, how to drive, how to do manicures...haven't started using blender yet, but its on my list.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the making of any visual novel games!
- 📫 How to reach me: pop me an email at stars.kingdom97@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wanted to be a plastic surgeon before I realised that I could make the games that I always wished existed.
